A lot of instant ramen can be lacking in flavour and nutrition. Even if not, there's always some room for improvement. Here are some ingredients that can seriously upgrade your instant ramen experience. 

My favourite instant ramen is [Nong Shim Shin Ramyun](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/noodles/85-nongshim-shin-ramyun-noodle-soup-120g-8801043150620.html), which is vegan. If you're in the west, please support your local Asian supermarket where possible!

## The upgrades

* Edamame beans
* Dried seaweed (use either cut up [nori sheets](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/condiments/2157-nagai-s-roasted-seaweed-sushinori-28g.html) or [seaweed flakes](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/home/2257-wel-pac-fueru-wakame-567-g.html) â€” I prefer the latter!)
* [Enoki mushrooms](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/fresh-asian/467-herman-kuijper-enoki-mushroom-100g-8717624002311.html)
* Spring onion (scallions)
* Chopped garlic
* Chopped ginger
* Tofu ([silken](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/fresh-asian/448-oriental-dragon-pasteurised-silken-tofu-350g-5060071580677.html) or [fried tofu](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/fresh-asian/471-fried-tofu-slices-170g.html) is best in my opinion)
* Soup paste such as [Tom Yum](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/hot-pot-soup-bases/1672-penta-instant-thai-yum-soup-paste-500g-8851081543304.html)
* [Sriracha](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/condiments/903-healthy-boy-sriracha-hot-chilli-sauce.html)
* Spinach
* [Pak choi (bok choi)](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/fresh-asian/1788-pak-choi-300g.html)
* [Beansprouts](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/fresh-asian/485-bean-sprouts-260g.html)
* Sesame seeds
* [Coconut milk](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/aroy-d/570-aroy-d-coconut-milk-400g-016229005122.html)
* [Soy sauce](https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/soy-sauce-fish-sauce/176-kikkoman-naturally-brewed-soy-sauce-250ml.html) (or tamari)

I've tried all of these and my personal favourite combo is dried seaweed, enoki mushroom and spring onion in the already very spicy Shin Ramyun. 

I'll continue to add to this list as I find more awesome things to add to ramen. [Let me know what you like to add to yours!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@joejoinerr)

_Dislaimer: I don't claim to be a ramen expert. I'm just a white guy that likes a good instant ramen._
