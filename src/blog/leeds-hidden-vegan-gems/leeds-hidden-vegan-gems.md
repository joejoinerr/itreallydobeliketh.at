Just some cool places I've found in Leeds that are less well-known(?) / don't promote their vegan stuff super well even though it's really good.

In no particular order :)

## Proove Pizza

Really tasty Neopolitan pizza and their vegan cheese is very good. They have a good selection of vegan pizza and sides, plus a vegan brownie. Delivery only, and not exactly cheap, but worth it for a treat. My fav: _Melazane_

## Friends of Food

The most amazing vegan burger I think I've ever had. They have a really good selection of burger styles, yummy sauces and some desserts. Also their fries are to die for, definitely get those. They have a few stools inside in Hyde Park, but mostly delivery only. My fav: _The Signature_

## Rasoi Stories

Full restaurant up in Chapel Allerton. They have a variety of Indian dishes, and most importantly some amazing vegan options --- not a huge range, but what they have is super good. Plus good for going with omni friends. Good [onion bhajis](https://itreallydobeliketh.at/blog/onion-bhaji-showdown/). My fav: _Kathal Lazeez_

## Livin' Italy

Again a really good one for omni friends, this is based pretty close to where I live. Handful of vegan main options and lots of vegan sides that are all really tasty. My fav: _Don't Call Me Vegan pizza_

## Kuala Lumpur Cafe

Little restaurant in Headingley known for its authentic Malaysian food. A lot of the menu is vegan but for whatever reason they just... don't shout about it?? However they have some of the best mock meat --- the vegan beef is just the best. My fav: _Nasi Lemak with Vegan Beef Rendang_

## Ambiente Tapas

Quite a popular restaurant but I don't think enough people know about how good their vegan menu is. They have awesome plant based versions of several meat dishes as well as amazing grilled veg options. They now also have a vegan paella which I am yet to try. My fav: _Mediterranean Veg Platter_

## Senbon Sakura

Super awesome little authentic Japanese restaurant at the top of the city centre with a HUGE menu including lots of vegan options. They have some good mock meat stuff but also lots of tofu and veg so you can really take your pick. Everything is so filling. Sushi to die for. My fav: _Vegan Pork Steak with Black Pepper Bento Box_

## Cat's Pyjamas

Restaurant with two locations, Headingley and Chapel Allerton, as well as delivery. I've been here _so many_ times because they have awesome vegan starter and main options. They've been through a few changes of management but the food has remained consistently good, and they are definitely one of my goto options. My fav: _Railway potato curry_

## Bonus: Great Yorkshire Vegan Festival

While not strictly a restaurant or delivery option, I wanted to include this as we've been a few times and always come away really happy. They have caterers from around the country and food things to take away (amongst other stalls). Always get so stuffed and its really fun to try stuff. Entry is Â£5 but so worth it. Can't choose a fav here since they always rotate.
